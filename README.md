## Issues ##

**During development**



## Deployment ##
---
**RecipeCloud** was developed on **GitPod**, using **GitHub** to host the repository and deployed on **GitHub Pages**.
**GitHub** made the deployment extremely painless:

* Connected to Github
* Selected the repository **JustWhittaker/PRO3-RecipeCloud**
* Clicked on **"settings"** in the navigation bar
* In the **GitHub Pages** I selected **Master Branch** and **/root** in the dropdown menu and clicked **Save**
* I waited 2 minutes.
* **The website is now live on https://justwhittaker.github.io/PRO3-RecipeCloud/**.

**Cloning** No issues:

* Why do we is it important to be able to clone successfully first **Collaboration** with team members if you are working in a scrum and secondly **Assist** other developers to use my main project to grow their own version.
* In my repository **JustWhittaker/PRO3-RecipeCloud**, click on the **"Code** green button, **copy in clipboard the HTTPS link**, open your **IDE** and look through my files.
* The link : **https://github.com/JustWhittaker/PRO3-RecipeCloud.git**
