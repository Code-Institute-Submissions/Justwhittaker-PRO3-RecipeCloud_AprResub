<h1>Milestone Project User Centric Python</h1>

<h1>MusicHub</h1>


<h2>UX</h2>

For the UX on this project I wanted to create a simple and user friendly site.
My target audience is between 18-39years old. Hence I chose vibarant colors, many visual aids 
such as videos, pictures and ensured that my social links are large and clickable.

I added plenty of href links to allow the user to find out more infomation and navigate the 
site with ease. I was very careful to ensure that any external links are opened in a seperate 
tab so that the user doesn't fully leave my site and can quickly return without forgetting how they got there.

<h3>User Perspectective Story</h3>
Herewith a discriptive step by step breakdown of the UX for User A:
<li>1. Landing page
    a. When landing on the Home page the user firsts notices the bright logo to know they have found the right page
    b. Alongside the logo you have the Nav bar links to help the user navigate the site efficently
    c. A short video starts to play in a canvas below the logo to keep user A interested and get them excited about the experience on offer
    d. The Footer has all the social links needed for further experience investigation and to show the User A the wonderful time they are going to experience if they book
    e. Furthermore there is a ref link in the footer bar to the Signup page to encourage and motivate the User into booking post haste.
</li>
<li>2. Event locations
    a. When the User A clicks the menu nav to event locations they will find all the event locations nationwide with images and titles.
    b. User A has the option of following the Href for each Location to City Facebooks links which provide further investigative infomation on other events and happenings in the city
    c. Furthermore there is an experience blog which provides User A different images of what happens at the event.
    d. The footer has been duplicated to provide further motivation to the signup page as well and the social links
</li>
<li>3. Wines 
    a. When the User A clicks the menu nav to Wines they will find all the wines showcased on a monthly basis.
    b. User A has the option of following the Href links for each winery's website link to provide further investigative infomation on the showedcased product as well as other products that the farm produces.
    c. The footer has been duplicated to provide further motivation to the signup page as well and the social links
</li>
<li>4. Sign up page
    a. This is the most valuable section of the website in terms of customer retention as well as income generation for the business
    b. The user has mutliple methods for reaching this page, the Nav bar and footer both have ref links to guide the User A into this important page.
    c. When the User lands on the page they will find a quick and easy sign up option, asking for basic infomation to help the marketing element as well as book the correct event.
    d. Once the user has entered all the infomation they would be directed to a paypal encription to safely enter their perferred payment method.
    e. once the payment is completed they will receive a ticket via email as well as a reference for their booking.
</li>
<li>5. The action that the User is taking on the website to to find further information regarding the event, it's locations and the price per ticket
</li>
<li>6. The goal of the User is to have a user friendly experience and to navigate though the pages with ease, completing a purchase by the end of the experience.
</li>

With this website I would like to achieve a higher pre event ticket sales,
giving the user many various methods in arriving to the signup menu, buttons and nav links, ensures that the user is very aware that 
tickets are available and are easy to buy for friends too.

With more pre-sales it allows the company to better estimate the total people that are coming,
bringing in early revenue allowing for less intitial capital expediture at the begining of the events.

Also it allows the company to liase correctly with the Wineries and distributers to ensure that they 
bring enough stock for the number of guests coming. 

The Wireframes were designed to ensure that the ease of use is continued throughout the website and that the UX is following the design process.
Wireframe was done on Balsamiq
        
<li>href ="https://balsamiq.cloud/s6vjh9d/pktgf7d"</li>
I have also included a word Document with the work done on Balsamiq as I fear that the link might have expired
https://github.com/Justwhittaker/PRO1-CITYVINE/blob/6e3a333c5ebb2b53708d4bdfef6d1bf7e7a54076/assets/images/wireframe%20cityvine.docx

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>

Feature 1 - allows users buy tickets to the events , by having them fill out the signup form. (signup.html)

<h2>Brower interchange</h2>

I used Bootstrap4 to ensure that my website is mobile first and used the veiwport abilty to ensure that the website is responisive at any device size

<h2>Debug, Testing & Issues</h2>

I have used https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjustwhittaker.github.io%2FPRO1-CITYVINE%2Findex.html to check my code errors and correct the issues.

Used the HTML parser. Externally specified character encoding was utf-8.

1. I found it difficult to ensure that the text-decoration was removed from the wineries web references on the wines page
        it also took me awhile to figure out the gallery method to ensure a good flow to the veiw.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
I used Github pages in Github to control the deployment of the website.
    You will find the deployment at https://justwhittaker.github.io/PRO1-CITYVINE/ 

Herewith a step by step guide to setup GitHub deployment
1. Go to the project repository in GitHub.
2. Go to your project's Code & Deploys page, in the Repository tab.
3. Click the CONNECT TO GITHUB button to connect your project with GitHub. 
4. Connect to one of your GitHub repositories.
5. Configure the deploy options. 
    if you prefer, you can select a particular branch instead of the master one.
    You can also disable automatic deploys. In this case, you can deploy your project manually by clicking the Deploy this branch button
6. Deploy your project.
    After you've triggered the deployment, you can follow it and also view the details about the build process
That’s it! Your website is deployed to the Internet! You and anyone with whom you share this link can view your 
project by navigating in your browser to the URL http://<your-github-username>.github.io.
